If you leave the U.S. for over 180 days, when you seek readmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may inspect and interrogate you to see whether you have been maintaining your permanent resident status or whether you have abandoned your status as a permanent resident.

Many countries accept a reentry permit in place of a passport. To find out whether the country you plan to travel to will accept a reentry permit, you may contact their embassy or consulate in the U.S.
